    "\n",
    "Two graphs, such as feature importance from Random Forest and a correlation heatmap of property features, provide insights to the internal and external factors in predicting rental prices in Victoria, Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internal Features:**\n",
    "1. Highest: Bedrooms\n",
    "* Feature importance graph shows highest importance (~0.25). Reason: more bedrooms suggest larger homes, more demand of land, thus higher rent. There might be more families or friend groups in Victoria population.\n",
    "* Correlation heatmap shows the highest positive correlation (0.11). Reason: confirms that properties with more bedrooms results in higher rent.\n",
    "* Property market expectation\n",
    "2. Lowest: Bathrooms\n",
    "* lowest importance (~0.20). Reason: Many properties have common number of bathrooms or families/roommates do not mind sharing shower spaces as long as they have their private sleeping area. \n",
    "* second highest correlation (0.09) with price, suggesting more bathrooms increases rental price. Reason: increased privacy, which increases demand for roommates, thus increase price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**External Features:**\n",
    "1. Highest: Distance to supermarkets \n",
    "* Lowest importance (~0.09). Reason: accessible and convenience for food and resources, higher quality of life, which increases rental demand\n",
    "* Unexpected positive correlation (0.015), suggesting as distance to supermarket increase, the rental price increase. Reason: Suburb areas may offer more space and quietness compared to commercial areas, thus increases rental desirability. \n",
    "1. Lowest: Distance to schools \n",
    "* Lowest importance (~0.05). Reason: Families may prefer to rent than buy, and may consider school's reputation isntead of distance to homes. Rental properties may appear to individuals with no children such as university students or job-priority professionals. \n",
    "* Low correlation (0.057) supports this. "
