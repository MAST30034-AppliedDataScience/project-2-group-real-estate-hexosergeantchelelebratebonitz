    "## 1. What are the most important internal and external features in predicting rental prices?\n",
    "\n",
    "Two graphs, such as feature importance from Random Forest and a correlation heatmap of property features, provide insights to the internal and external factors in predicting rental prices in Victoria, Australia.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internal Features:**\n",
    "1. **Bathrooms**\n",
    "* Point: bathrooms have highest importance in predicting rental prices.\n",
    "* Evidence: feature importance (0.175), positive correlation (0.46) \n",
    "* Explain: more bathrooms suggests increased privacy, especially in shared/family homes, thus increased demand, thus increases rental price.\n",
    "* Link: \n",
    "    *  Investors target properties with multiple bathrooms to attract families and friend groups, leading to higher rent. \n",
    "    * Renters are more aware that more bathrooms means higher rental costs, thus opportunity costs between privacy or affordability. \n",
    "2. **Bedrooms**\n",
    "* Point: bedrooms have 2nd highest importance in predicting rental prices.\n",
    "* Evidence: feature importance (0.12), positive correlation (0.31) \n",
    "* Explain: larger homes attract families/groups, higher demand for land area, so increases demand.\n",
    "* Link: \n",
    "    *  Investors target properties with more bedrooms in areas with rising demand to maximise returns.\n",
    "    * Renters understand that more bedrooms means higher rental costs but ideal for families or shared living.\n",
    "\n",
    "**External Features:**\n",
    "1. Highest: Distance to closest Tram \n",
    "* Point: proximity to tram stops influences rental price\n",
    "* Evidence: Feature importance (0.125), negative correlation (-0.02). As the property's distance from the nearest tram stop decreases, the rental price increases. \n",
    "* Explanation: convenience to public transport, higher demand for renters who do not drive\n",
    "* Link: \n",
    "    * Investors target properties close to tram stops, usually near CBD. \n",
    "    * Renters understand trade off between convenience going to work with nearby trams but higher rents.\n",
    "2. Distance to Melbourne CBD \n",
    "* Point: proximity to City Centre are important in predicting rental prices. \n",
    "* Evidence: Feature importance (0.12), negative correlation (-0.2): As the distance to CBD decreases, the rental price increases.\n",
    "* Explain: employment opportunities, amenities convenience, more universities, city life\n",
    "* Link: \n",
    "    *  Investors target properties near CBD to provide highest growth potential.\n",
    "    * Renters can budget by living further from CBD to get lower rents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: \n",
    "* Investors should invest on properties near the CBD with many tram stops nearby, where properties have a large number of bathrooms or bedrooms. This is usually for student groups demographic who prefer to live in apartment or shared houses in city centre.\n",
    "* Renters looking for affordable rent should live in suburban areas with limited tram access and be open to sharing bathrooms or bedrooms with roommates."

    "* Average projected growth of 9.16% from 2023-2026\n",

    "Liveability Score is weighted and justified as:\n",
    "1. Average Property Price: 50% weight, since affordability was assumed as top priority for renters seeking livability.\n",
    "2. Distance to the Closest Supermarket: 16.6% weight, since convenience and accessibility to daily necessities improves quality of life.\n",
    "3. Average Distance to Public Transport (PTV): 16.6% weight, because convenient access to public transport reduced commuting stress thus better quality of life.\n",
    "4. Distance to the Closest School: 16.6% weight, as convenience to school is important for families with children. This factor has the same weight as transport and supermarket proximity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lower liveability score is better due to the distance negatively correlation with better living conditions. For example, there is an inverse relationship where less distance to supermarket means a property is more liveable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our results are described below:\n",
    "* Top 3 Livable Suburbs West Melbourne, Seddon, Footscray, from the bar plots for Top 20 Livable Suburbs\n",
    "* Livable suburbs highly concentrated around Melbourne CBD to nearby Suburb areas, from the Heatmap\n",
    "* Explain: Suburban areas near CBD has balance of affordability and convenient access to necessities, commuting options, and education.\n",
    "West Melbourne, Seddon, and Footscray are 20 minutes driving distance from CBD, which is not too long, and their trams and service infrastructure are still well-developed, thus contributing to liveability. \n",
    "* Link: \n",
    "    * Investors can invest on cheaper suburbs compared to CBD centres, with more stable rental demand due to balance of affordability and convenience.\n",
    "    * Renters can live affordably without sacrificing convenience and expensive costs of CBD's rent."
