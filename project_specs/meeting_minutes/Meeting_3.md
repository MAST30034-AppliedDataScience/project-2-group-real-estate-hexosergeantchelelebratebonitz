    - We had to discard our previous shapefile from last week, due to irrelevant features like roads and postcodes (Spatial DataShare, https://s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/cl-isd-prd-datashare-s3-delivery/Order_MUYRC6.zip)
• Decided on 4 external datasets choices: public transport (ptv), school, supermarkets, hospital
